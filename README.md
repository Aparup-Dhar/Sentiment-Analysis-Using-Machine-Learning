# Title
Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

# Description
Twitter is a prominent social media website which provides a platform where millions of
users share their unfiltered thoughts, opinions, and emotions in real-time. Platforms like
this thus become an archive and collection of large amounts of data. This wealth of data has
given rise to a fascinating field of study known as "Sentiment Analysis" which falls under
the umbrella of "Natural Language Processing (NLP)" a subfield of Artificial Intelligence
(AI). By applying NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms sentiment analysis can
be performed on a large collection of tweets (Twitter messages) in order to gain insights
into public sentiment, emotions, and opinions expressed on the Twitter platform.
